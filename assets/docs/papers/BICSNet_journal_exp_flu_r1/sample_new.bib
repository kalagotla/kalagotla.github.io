   abstract = {1. Recent investigations have called attention to the question as to how closely the rate of fall of particles through a fluid when very small approximates to that given by the law obtained by Stokes from hydrodynamical reasoning. This paper deals theoretically with two of the main sources of divergence from that law. Firstly, taking the particles to be smooth spheres moving through a gas, it is shown that the deviation to be expected on account of the diameter of the particle being small, compared with the molecular free path, is extremely small for such particles as have been experimented with; and a modified formula is given which may be taken to hold approximately for lower pressures or particles of smaller dimensions. Secondly, an approximate treatment is made of the effect of the simultaneous presence of a large number of particles moving with the same velocity through the fluid, and it is found that the force required to maintain the motion of one of them depends not only on the diameter, but on the ratio of the diameter to the distance between the particles, and in such a way as to increase rapidly as this ratio increases beyond the value 0·1.},

This law, valid from continuum to free molecule conditions, for Re less than or similar to 200 and M less than or similar to 1 (where Re and M are, respectively, the Reynolds and Mach numbers based on relative velocity), is used to compare calculated and experimental values of the drag coefficient, as well as the particle velocities across an oblique shock wave.

   abstract = {The production of monodisperse tracer particles with suitable properties for optical flow investigations, such as small size, spherical shape, smooth surface, appropriate density and diffraction index, non-evaporating and agglomerating, electrically neutral, non-toxic and easily removable, is a challenging task due to the sensitivity of the particle size distribution to the boundary conditions. In order to obtain general design and operating rules for atomizers which are mostly applied for air flows, this dependence is investigated here. It is shown that high concentrations of narrow band particle size distributions, with a mean diameter below 1 µm, can easily be generated by means of multi-hole nozzles under over-critical pressure conditions, when the kinetic energy, transferred into the seeding liquid through the nozzle exits, is well balanced with the liquid volume inside the atomizer. In addition, flow visualization pictures are presented which permit a useful assessment of the functioning of the nozzles and reveal operating features of the atomizers which were not previously known. In particular, it is shown that existing explanations of the importance of certain design features of the Laskin nozzle are of minor importance for the generation of appropriate tracer particles.},

   abstract = {Large-scale particle image velocimetry (LSPIV) is a nonintrusive approach to measure velocities at the free surface of a water body. The raw LSPIV results are instantaneous water surface velocity fields, spanning flow areas up to hundreds of square meters. Measurements conducted in typical conditions in conjunction with appropriate selections of parameters for image processing resulted in mean velocity errors of less than 3.5%. The current article reviews the background of LSPIV and the work of three research teams spanning over a decade. Implementation examples using various LSPIV configurations are then described to illustrate the capability of the technique to characterize spatially distributed two- and three-dimensional flow kinematic features that can be related to important morphologic and hydrodynamic aspects of natural rivers. Finally, results and a critique of research methods are discussed to encourage LSPIV use and to improve its capabilities to collect field data needed to better understand complex geomorphic, hydrologic, and ecologic river processes and interactions under normal and extreme conditions.},

This was mainly possiblewith the advent of short interframing-time CCD cameras with temporalresolution allowing to obtain correlated particle images at flow velocitiesexceeding 1000m∕s. The most challenging aspects of PIV experiments insupersonic flows are still recognized as the seeding-particle-selection andseeding-distribution techniques. Also, the optical access for illumination andimaging require a specific attention since pressurized facilities offer limitedoptical access. The presence of shock waves in supersonic flows introducesregions where particle tracers slip with respect to the surrounding flow.Moreover, the particle seeding density becomes strongly nonuniform andparticle-image blur can occur as a result of the strong refractive index variations.The present chapter reviews the physical and technical problems of PIVexperiments and discusses the potential of such techniques on the basis of recentexperiments performed in high-speed wind tunnels: double compression rampat Mach 7 and shock-wave turbulent boundary interaction at Mach 2.},

   title = {Computational Fluid Dynamics Investigation into Shock Boundary Layer Interactions in the &#8220;Glass Inlet&#8221; Wind Tunnel},
   university = {University of Cincinnati},
   abstract = {<p>Mixed compression inlets offer a potential increase in pressure recovery compared to conventional external compression inlets at Mach numbers above two. However, these inlets suffer from problems with shock boundary layer interactions which cause flow instabilities and severe performance reductions. Previous experiments conducted at the University of Michigan used a wind tunnel with glass side walls and an extensive test section to measure the shock boundary layer interaction associated with a single oblique shock. This work presents an investigation of possible improvements to the current single shock experiment. A 10&#176; oblique shock generator was designed by researchers at the University of Michigan and simulated at the University of Cincinnati. The 10&#176; design did not start in the actual wind tunnel, but was successfully simulated by bypassing the transients from quiescent flow with the help of an initial solution generated from one dimensional inviscid nozzle theory. The residuals from the simulation leveled off at higher levels than expected in some mesh blocks, which indicates unsteadiness. The same case was then simulated in a time accurate manner, and showed very small variations in the solution over time. The magnitude of these variations were large enough to prevent the residuals in the steady simulation from dropping, but small enough that an averaged solution could be used for analysis. A grid dependency study was conducted and found that the 24 million node grid is very close to being grid independent.</p> <p>A new design was desired that would allow the actual tunnel to start, and this resulted in a 6&#176; oblique shock generator. This geometry allows the tunnel to start, and produces a more benign shock boundary layer interaction than the 10&#176; oblique shock generator. A follow up experiment has been designed where the oblique shock is followed by a normal shock and a subsonic diffuser. This new configuration will provide insights into the effects that combined oblique and normal shock boundary layer interactions have on the health of the boundary layer in the diffuser section of a mixed compression inlet. The extensive glass walls of the wind tunnel will allow direct access for optical measurements of the shock boundary layer interactions and the diffuser section.</p> <p>Corner separations in a tunnel affect the flow in the center of the tunnel. The oblique shock causes the low momentum flow in the tunnel corners to separate. This in turn creates shocks at the separation bubble leading edge that propagates into the flow-field. Depending on the size of the tunnel and the Reynolds number, these shocks can meet at the tunnel centerline and cause a pressure rise. This pressure rise can help to keep the boundary layer attached by smearing the pressure gradient, or intensify separations by adding an additional region of adverse pressure gradients, depending on where the corner shocks interact relative to the main shock boundary layer interaction.</p>},

A fundamental exploration pertaining to the effects of particle image velocimetry (PIV) on post-processing data is also shown. Results showed an improvement in agreement with experimental data with key contributions by adding a laminar zone upstream of the wedge (the flow is considered transitional downstream of the nozzle throat) and the necessity of mimicking PIV particle lag for comparisons.

In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

   title = {Modeling Particle Drag in Accelerating Flows with Implications for SBLI in PIV - A Numerical Analysis},
   university = {University of Cincinnati},
   abstract = {Since its inception, Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) has been increasingly used to measure the velocity of the flow field, especially in aerospace applications. One of the major assumptions of PIV is that velocity of the flow field is same as the velocity of tracers in it. The ability of PIV to measure velocity depends upon the potential of tracers to track the flow surrounding them. Shock-Boundary Layer Interactions (SBLIs) have been studied extensively over the years using experimental and computational methods due to their importance in almost every supersonic flow. PIV has been doing a great job in analyzing SBLIs over the past few years but it has its limitations especially when there are high temporal and spatial accelerations. On the other hand, numerical simulations that better predict shock interactions have a hard time analyzing the turbulence properties of SBLIs. This implies that only by using both computational and experimental results together physics of SBLIs can be better understood. The current study was divided into two parts. First, development and validation of a post-processing code to be able to accommodate the solid particles. For this, Visual3 has been chosen because it lets a user control even smallest of its processes. Visual3 code has been modified to track particles using accurate physics within a flow. Forces acting on a particle in a flow were analyzed and compared using data obtained from Modified-Visual3 (MV3). Based on this data, dominant forces on a particle in high-speed flow are determined. Results obtained from Modified-Visual3 are compared with Melling(1997) data to validate the code. A specific case is solved mathematically to compare with Modified-Visual3 and Melling&apos;s data. A second validation was done using an example of a generalized oblique shock to understand the behavior of the particle passing through the shock. Finally, particle relaxation times for different particle specifications were calculated to understand which particles have better traceability to use in Particle Image Velocimetry(PIV). Second, the MV3 code was used to post-process the CFD results of the UM-PIV data. These CFD results were obtained from the numerical analyses conducted at the UC. A standard case with 2.75 Mach and 7.75&deg; wedge angle were used in MV3 to be in compliance with the CFD analysis. Particle, fluid velocities, position at every instant were collected from MV3 and were later used for comparison. This obtained data was filtered using a Python script to compare with the experimental plane defined in Eagle&apos;s (2011) work. Different particle sizes were used to compare the obtained results. These results were then used to analyze particle lag, velocity differences, velocity and acceleration contours. Finally, an error analysis was done to compare PIV, CFD and particle data. Results obtained from particulate data showed remarkable improvement in agreement with experimental data. Streamwise velocity, which was previously a major drawback, has shown a considerable improvement. This implies that particle lag in PIV plays an important role in analyzing flow especially when there are high spatial accelerations as is the case in SBLIs.},

   journal = {Measurement Science and Technology},
   volume = {30},
   number = {9},
   abstract = {Particle image velocimetry (PIV) has become the chief experimental technique for velocity field measurements in fluid flows. The technique yields quantitative visualizations of the instantaneous flow patterns, which are typically used to support the development of phenomenological models for complex flows or for validation of numerical simulations. However, due to the complex relationship between measurement errors and experimental parameters, the quantification of the PIV uncertainty is far from being a trivial task and has often relied upon subjective considerations. Recognizing the importance of methodologies for the objective and reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) of experimental data, several PIV-UQ approaches have been proposed in recent years that aim at the determination of objective uncertainty bounds in PIV measurements.
This topical review on PIV uncertainty quantification aims to provide the reader with an overview of error sources in PIV measurements and to inform them of the most up-to-date approaches for PIV uncertainty quantification and propagation. The paper first introduces the general definitions and classifications of measurement errors and uncertainties, following the guidelines of the International Organization for Standards (ISO) and of renowned books on the topic. Details on the main PIV error sources are given, considering the entire measurement chain from timing and synchronization of the data acquisition system, to illumination, mechanical properties of the tracer particles, imaging of those, analysis of the particle motion, data validation and reduction. The focus is on planar PIV experiments for the measurement of two- or three-component velocity fields.
Approaches for the quantification of the uncertainty of PIV data are discussed. Those are divided into a-priori UQ approaches, which provide a general figure for the uncertainty of PIV measurements, and a-posteriori UQ approaches, which are data-based and aim at quantifying the uncertainty of specific sets of data. The findings of a-priori PIV-UQ based on theoretical modelling of the measurement chain as well as on numerical or experimental assessments are discussed. The most up-to-date approaches for a-posteriori PIV-UQ are introduced, highlighting their capabilities and limitations.
As many PIN/ experiments aim at determining flow properties derived from the velocity fields (e.g. vorticity, time-average velocity, Reynolds stresses, pressure), the topic of PIV uncertainty propagation is tackled considering the recent investigations based on Taylor series and Monte Carlo methods. Finally, the uncertainty quantification of 3D velocity measurements by volumetric approaches (tomographic PIV and Lagrangian particle tracking) is discussed.},

   abstract = {Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves(1) and in the first imaging of a black hole(2). Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},
