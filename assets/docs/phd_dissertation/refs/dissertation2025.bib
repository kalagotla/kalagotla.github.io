   title = {Estimation of the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy: A review},
   journal = {Chemical Engineering Science},
   volume = {229},
   pages = {116133},
   abstract = {A comprehensive literature review on the estimation of the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy is presented to assess the current state of knowledge available in this area. Experimental techniques (hot wires, LDV, PIV and PTV) reported on the measurements of turbulent dissipation rate have been critically analyzed with respect to the velocity processing methods. Traditional hot wires and LDV are both a point-based measurement technique with high temporal resolution and Taylor’s frozen hypothesis is generally required to transfer temporal velocity fluctuations into spatial velocity fluctuations in turbulent flows. Multi probes of hot wires and multi points LDV could be used to measure velocity spatial gradients for a direct calculation of turbulent dissipation rate from its definition. Nevertheless, only PIV and PTV could provide simultaneous measurements of the distribution of turbulent dissipation rate in a turbulent field. These methods all suffer from the deficiency of spatial resolution as velocity measurements are required to resolve down to Kolmogorov scales for a strictly direct calculation of turbulent dissipation rate from fluctuating velocity gradients. To eliminate the necessity of resolving down to Kolmogorov scales, a large eddy simulation analogy and Smagorinsky model could be used for estimating the unresolved small scales, but Smagorinsky constant acts as an adjustment parameter at this stage. Different velocity processing methods are compared in the estimation of turbulent dissipation rate. The estimation of turbulent dissipation rate using structure function, energy spectrum and dimensional analysis methods could reduce the effects of low resolution, but it only provides temporal or spatial mean turbulent dissipation rate. Nevertheless, the field of turbulent dissipation rate, which is not distributed homogeneously, has intermittent spatio-temporal nature. The aim of this paper is to review the developments and limitations of the existing experimental techniques and different calculating methods and identify the future directions in successfully estimating turbulent dissipation rate in turbulent multiphase flows.},

This study presents a novel deep neural network (DNN) approach to correct these biases, leveraging a bilateral convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. The network is trained to emulate real-world PIV scenarios using approximately 73,000 synthetic images representing a range of Mach numbers, deflection angles, shock strengths, particle properties, and magnifications. The model achieves significant reductions in particle inertia bias by incorporating physical parameters such as Mach and Reynolds numbers, with predictions closely matching analytical solutions across diverse flow conditions.

   abstract = {New subgrid-scale models for the large-eddy simulation of compressible turbulent flows are developed and tested based on the Favre-filtered equations of motion for an ideal gas. A compressible generalization of the linear combination of the Smagorinsky model and scale-similarity model, in terms of Favre-filtered fields, is obtained for the subgrid-scale stress tensor. An analogous thermal linear combination model is also developed for the subgrid-scale heat flux vector. The two dimensionless constants associated with these subgrid-scale models are obtained by correlating with the results of direct numerical simulations of compressible isotropic turbulence performed on a 963 grid using Fourier collocation methods. Extensive comparisons between the direct and modelled subgrid-scale fields are provided in order to validate the models. A large-eddy simulation of the decay of compressible isotropic turbulence – conducted on a coarse 323 grid – is shown to yield results that are in excellent agreement with the fine-grid direct simulation. Future applications of these compressible subgrid-scale models to the large-eddy simulation of more complex supersonic flows are discussed briefly.},

   abstract = {Quantifying the turbulent dissipation rate provides insight into the physics of the turbulent flows. However, the accuracy of estimating turbulent dissipation rate using velocity data measured by planar PIV is affected by the way of modeling the unresolved velocity gradient terms and the PIV spatial resolution. In this paper, we first give a brief review of different methods used to estimate turbulent dissipation rate. Then synthetic PIV data are generated from a turbulence DNS dataset for validating the effectiveness of different methods. Direct estimate of turbulent dissipation rate from its definition using velocity gradients, with the assumption of isotropy, local axisymmetry, or local isotropy, shows significant decrease as interrogation window size increases. On the other hand, the indirect estimation of turbulent dissipation rate from energy spectra and structure function demonstrate less severe decrease as interrogation window size increases. We further propose two modified methods. The Modified Structure Function Method relies on an empirical relationship established by analyzing the synthetic PIV data. For a given measured value turbulent dissipation rate under a given interrogation window size, the true value can be determined from this relationship. The Modified Spectra Curvefit Method accounts the averaging effect introduced by the interrogation window in PIV processing algorithm and thus gives a better calculation of the energy spectra. When the new spectra data are used to curve fit the -5/3 slope, an improved estimate of turbulent dissipation rate is expected. Both modified methods are applied to experimental PIV data acquired from a turbulent jet experiment. They give nearly converged estimates of turbulent dissipation rate and Kolmogorov scale at different interrogation window sizes.},

The effect of microjet penetration on the far-field acoustics is studied by altering the number of injectors, the cross-sectional area of each injector, and the injection mass flow. The injectors are evenly distributed around the nozzle exit. The injection angle is 90 deg relative to the main jet flow. This research is a continuation of a previous large-eddy simulation study of pulsed injection that showed that the unsteady injection-induced pressure pulses in the jet caused increased tonal noise for far-field observers at low angles. Flapping jet injection was shown to minimize the creation of the pressure pulses, except for high-amplitude flapping angles and high injection mass flows, where the injections divert out of the shear layer and introduce periodic superposition of the double shock-cell structure. Furthermore, the flapping injection did not show improved noise reduction compared with the steady injection, which is essentially promising because steady injection proves to be a more practical solution for implementation in real jet engine applications.},

   abstract = {The three-dimensional spatial filtering and measurement noise associated with experimental planar and three-dimensional (3D) particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements is investigated using a combination of direct numerical simulations (DNS) and experimental databases. Spatial filtering velocity fields from a DNS of a zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer (TBL) at resolutions typical of PIV experiments are shown to underestimate Reynolds stresses by as much as 50 %. Comparison of experimental PIV measurement of a turbulent channel flow and 3D tomographic PIV measurements of a TBL with higher-resolution simulations and hot-wire anemometry measurements show that in real experiments, measurement noise acts to offset this effect. This is shown to produce measurements that appear to provide a good estimate of the turbulent fluctuations in the flow, when in reality the flow is spatially under-resolved and partially contaminated by noise. Means of identifying this noise are demonstrated using the one-dimensional (1D) velocity power spectra and the 1D transfer function between the power spectra of the unfiltered velocity field and the power spectra calculated from the filtered experimental measurement. This 1D transfer function differs from the commonly used sinc transfer function of PIV owing to the integrated effect of filtering in multiple directions. Failure to incorporate this difference is shown to overestimate the maximum resolved wave number in the 3D spectra of the planar PIV by close to 10 %, while conversely underestimating the maximum resolved wave number in the 3D PIV by 50 %. Appropriate spatial filtering of the experimental data is shown to remove the noise-dominated small-scale fluctuations and bring the data inline with that which should be obtained for a noiseless PIV measurement at the corresponding spatial resolution.},

   title = {AN INVESTIGATION OF INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES FOR REDUCTION OF JET NOISE IN MEDIUM AND HIGH BYPASS RATIO TURBOFAN ENGINES},
   university = {University of Cincinnati},
   abstract = {This research project has developed a new, large-scale, nozzle acoustic test rig capable of simulating the exhaust flows of separate flow exhaust systems in medium and high bypass turbofan engines. This rig has subsequently been used to advance the understanding of two state-of-the-art jet noise reduction technologies. The first technology investigated is an emerging jet noise reduction technology known as chevron nozzles. The fundamental goal of this investigation was to advance the understanding of the fundamental physical mechanisms responsible for the acoustic benefits provided by these nozzles. Additionally, this study sought to establish the relationship between these physical mechanisms and the chevron geometric parameters. A comprehensive set of data was collected, including far-field and near-field acoustic data as well as flow field measurements. In addition to illustrating the ability of the chevron nozzles to provide acoustic benefits in important aircraft certification metrics such as effective perceived noise level (EPNL), this investigation successfully identified two of the fundamental physical mechanisms responsible for this reduction. The flow field measurements showed the chevron to redistribute energy between the core and fan streams to effectively reduce low frequency noise by reducing the length of the jet potential core. However, this redistribution of energy produced increases in turbulent kinetic energy of up to 45% leading to a degradation of the chevron benefit at higher frequencies. Trends observed with respect to the chevron geometry showed that the chevron penetration could be matched to the exhaust flow conditions to optimally balance the trade between low frequency reduction and high frequency increase to maximize reductions in EPNL. Secondly, a completely new technology, known as fluidic injection, was investigated. This technology consists of applying continuous air injection, from a number of small injection jets, at the nozzle exit plane to reduce jet noise. The principal advantage of such an approach is that it is an active technology that can be activated as needed and, as such, may be more acceptable in aircraft engines from a performance standpoint than passive technologies. This study successfully demonstrated the feasibility of this technology by showing that effective jet noise reduction can be provided in a broad range of flow conditions using less than 1% of the mean jet mass flow. An investigation of injection geometric parameters identified the injection pitch angle as the most influential parameter with respect to jet noise reduction. Furthermore, an investigation of scaling effects showed a momentum ratio of approximately 1.5% to provide reductions in sound pressure level between 1 and 2 dB across a wide range of frequencies for a wide range of flow conditions and scales including both single stream and dual stream flows. PIV flow field measurements identified the fundamental physical mechanism of the noise reduction to be a near uniform reduction in shear layer turbulence.},

   title = {Supersonic Jet Noise Reduction with Novel Fluidic Injection Techniques},
   university = {University of Cincinnati},
   abstract = {Supersonic jets provide unique challenges in the aeroacoustic field due to very high jet velocities, shock associated noise components, flow dependence on jet expansion, and stringent performance requirements. Current noise suppression technology for commercial and military jet engines revolves around using chevrons or mechanical vortex generators to increase mixing near the nozzle exit, subsequently reducing peak turbulence levels in the mixing region. Passive noise control methods such as mechanical chevrons cause thrust loss throughout the flight envelope and performance can vary with the engine operating condition. Development of active noise control methods have the potential of improved performance throughout the flight envelope and the benefit of being deactivated when noise control is unnecessary. Fluidic injection of air into a supersonic jet is studied as an active control method with an emphasis on understanding the physics of the problem and identifying the controlling parameters. An experimental investigation with computational collaboration was conducted to understand the effect of nozzle design on supersonic jet noise and to develop various fluidic injection techniques to control noise from a supersonic jet with a design Mach number of 1.56. The jet was studied at overexpanded, ideally expanded, and underexpanded conditions to evaluate the effects throughout the operational envelope. As a passive noise control method, the internal contour of a realistic nozzle was modified to investigate the effect on acoustics and performance. Thrust was improved up to 10% with no acoustic penalties through nozzle design, however it was found that the shock noise components were highly sensitive to the shock structure in the jet. Steady fluidic injection was used to generate vorticity at the trailing edge of the nozzle showing that noise reduction is achieved through vorticity generation, modification of the shock structure, and interference with the screech feedback mechanism by decoupling the phase relationship between jet turbulence and shock spacing. Reduction of shock noise was found to be optimum at an intermediate injection pressure due to shock weakening from the fluidic injectors and injector interactions with the jet shock-expansion structure. Large-scale mixing noise reduction was shown to depend on the vorticity strength and circulation. Unprecedented reduction of OASPL up to -8.5 dB were achieved at the peak noise direction through strong jet mixing and rapid collapse of the potential core. Pulsed fluidic injection was investigated to understand the acoustic benefits and drawbacks of unsteady injection. Valve frequency response up to 500 Hz was achieved but noise reduction dropped off above 100 Hz due to poor flow response as verified by hot-wire and dynamic pressure measurements. At low pulse frequencies it was found that moderate noise reduction could be achieved with less flow than steady injection, but in general the mixing noise reduction scaled with the time integrated mass flow injection. It was discovered that the different components of supersonic jet noise had different characteristic response times to unsteady injection. Analysis of high speed shadowgraph images and acoustic spectra was used to identify time response of the jet during the unsteady injection cycle.},

   title = {Computational Fluid Dynamics Investigation into Shock Boundary Layer Interactions in the Glass Inlet Wind Tunnel},
   university = {University of Cincinnati},
   abstract = {Mixed compression inlets offer a potential increase in pressure recovery compared to conventional external compression inlets at Mach numbers above two. However, these inlets suffer from problems with shock boundary layer interactions which cause flow instabilities and severe performance reductions. Previous experiments conducted at the University of Michigan used a wind tunnel with glass side walls and an extensive test section to measure the shock boundary layer interaction associated with a single oblique shock. This work presents an investigation of possible improvements to the current single shock experiment. A 10; oblique shock generator was designed by researchers at the University of Michigan and simulated at the University of Cincinnati. The 10; design did not start in the actual wind tunnel, but was successfully simulated by bypassing the transients from quiescent flow with the help of an initial solution generated from one dimensional inviscid nozzle theory. The residuals from the simulation leveled off at higher levels than expected in some mesh blocks, which indicates unsteadiness. The same case was then simulated in a time accurate manner, and showed very small variations in the solution over time. The magnitude of these variations were large enough to prevent the residuals in the steady simulation from dropping, but small enough that an averaged solution could be used for analysis. A grid dependency study was conducted and found that the 24 million node grid is very close to being grid independent.</p> <p>A new design was desired that would allow the actual tunnel to start, and this resulted in a 6; oblique shock generator. This geometry allows the tunnel to start, and produces a more benign shock boundary layer interaction than the 10; oblique shock generator. A follow up experiment has been designed where the oblique shock is followed by a normal shock and a subsonic diffuser. This new configuration will provide insights into the effects that combined oblique and normal shock boundary layer interactions have on the health of the boundary layer in the diffuser section of a mixed compression inlet. The extensive glass walls of the wind tunnel will allow direct access for optical measurements of the shock boundary layer interactions and the diffuser section.</p> <p>Corner separations in a tunnel affect the flow in the center of the tunnel. The oblique shock causes the low momentum flow in the tunnel corners to separate. This in turn creates shocks at the separation bubble leading edge that propagates into the flow-field. Depending on the size of the tunnel and the Reynolds number, these shocks can meet at the tunnel centerline and cause a pressure rise. This pressure rise can help to keep the boundary layer attached by smearing the pressure gradient, or intensify separations by adding an additional region of adverse pressure gradients, depending on where the corner shocks interact relative to the main shock boundary layer interaction.</p>},

   abstract = {Two particle image velocimetry (PIV) softwares applied to turbulent flows are compared. One is based on a standard cross-correlation (CC) algorithm and the other is based on an iterative multi-pyramid optical flow (OF) algorithm. First, still particle images are used to evaluate the cut-off frequency induced by each method. Then a step response analysis highlights the capabilities of each method to minimise the effect of unresolved velocity gradients. Two different benchmarks with various turbulent length-scales, down to the Taylor microscale, are then used to analyse the velocity spectra and the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation estimation. First, a synthetic PIV dataset of homogeneous isotropic turbulence is processed and compared with direct numerical simulation (DNS) results. Then a grid turbulence wind tunnel experimental dataset is used to calculate velocity spectra and second-order structure functions, which are compared to laser Doppler velocimetry spectra. All these results point to the fact that, although OF is more diffusive and up to 5% less accurate than cross-correlation, the numerical diffusion improves the calculation of sub-window unresolved gradients and allows for direct and more robust measurement of the onset of the viscous subrange in experimental turbulent flows.},

   volume = {64},
   number = {1},
   pages = {12},
   abstract = {Particle image velocimetry (PIV) is a broadly used technique in fluid dynamics experiments. Traditional velocity derivation algorithms, e.g., the cross-correlation-based WIDIM (widow deformation iterative multi-grid method) and optical flow-based HS (Horn–Schunck), are still somewhat challenged by computational efficiency and model robustness, as well as their sensitivity to parameter settings such as the size of interrogation window. A few recent works have proposed different velocity calculation methods based on deep learning and present superiority on addressing the challenges, but the methods still need further exploration on the relevant accuracy and robustness. This paper reports an end-to-end convolutional neural network, namely PIV-PWCNet, to reconstruct the dense velocity field from particle image pairs. The main aim is to improve the accuracy and robustness of the velocimetry algorithms, meanwhile maintain a low computational cost. The PIV-PWCNet uses an available net, PWCNet, as the flow constructing backbone and makes special modification and enhancement to the network structure, flow estimator, refinement network, and loss function to allow the new model applicable for PIV measurements. The proposed PIV-PWCNet was tested on both synthesized and experimental particle images, showing higher accuracy than the cross-correlation-based WIDIM method, presenting superior robustness than the optical flow-based HS method, and outperforming the deep-learning-based PIV-NetS and PIV-DCNN models in accurately recovering flow details. In addition, the proposed PIV-PWCNet also has advantages such as high vector content and image processing efficiency.},

   abstract = {Deep learning technique, has made tremendous progress in fluid mechanics in recent years, because of its mighty feature extraction capacity from complicated and massive fluid data. Motion estimation and analysis of fluid data is one of the significant research topics in fluid mechanics. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of fluid motion (i.e., velocity field) estimation methods based on deep learning. Essentially, the fluid super-resolution (SR) reconstruction task can also be regarded as an velocity field estimation from low resolution to high resolution. To this end, we mainly give a review on two topics: fluid motion estimation and later velocity field super-resolution reconstruction. Specifically, we first introduce the basic principle and component of deep learning methods. We then review and analyze deep learning based methods on fluid motion estimation. Note we mainly investigate the commonly used fluid motion estimation approach here, particle image velocimetry (PIV) algorithm, which extract velocity field from successive particle images pair in a non-contact manner. In addition, SR reconstruction methods for velocity fields based on deep learning technique are also reviewed. Eventually, we give a discussion and possible routes for the future research works. To our knowledge, this paper are the first to give a review of deep learning-based approaches for fluid velocity field estimation.},

We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

Even though they can take advantage of semi-supervised setups with extra-unlabeled data, deep rectifier networks can reach their best performance without requiring any unsupervised pre-training on purely supervised tasks with large labeled datasets. Hence, these results can be seen as a new milestone in the attempts at understanding the difficulty in training deep but purely supervised neural networks, and closing the performance gap between neural networks learnt with and without unsupervised pre-training.},

Multiple drag models, including Stokes, Schiller-Nauman, Melling, Tedeschi, and Loth, are compared to evaluate their effectiveness in predicting particle response across different Mach regimes and shock strengths. The findings highlight the superiority of empirical models like Loth and Tedeschi over traditional Stokes-based approaches, especially in low supersonic flows where inertial effects are significant. A novel method to estimate underlying particle size distributions from oblique shock response data is introduced, addressing the challenge of particle agglomeration and breakup in supersonic flows.

   journal = {Measurement Science and Technology},

   pages = {R1},
   abstract = {Image processing methods for particle image velocimetry (PIV) are reviewed. The discussion focuses on iterative methods aimed at enhancing the precision and spatial resolution of numerical interrogation schemes. Emphasis is placed on the efforts made to overcome the limitations of the correlation interrogation method with respect to typical problems such as in-plane loss of pairs, velocity gradient compensation and correlation peak locking. The discussion shows how the correlation signal benefits from simple operations such as the window-offset technique, or the continuous window deformation, which compensates for the in-plane velocity gradient. The image interrogation process is presented within the discussion of the image matching problem and several algorithms and implementations currently in use are classified depending on the choice made about the particle image pattern matching scheme. Several methods that differ in their implementations are found to be substantially similar. Iterative image deformation methods that account for the continuous particle image pattern transformation are analysed and the effect of crucial choices such as image interpolation method, displacement prediction correction and correlation peak fit scheme are discussed. The quantitative performance assessment made through synthetic PIV images yields order-of-magnitude improvement on the precision of the particle image displacement at a sub-pixel level when the image deformation is applied. Moreover, the issue of spatial resolution is addressed and the limiting factors of the specific interrogation methods are discussed. Finally, an attempt for a flow-adaptive spatial resolution method is proposed. The method takes into account the local velocity derivatives in order to perform a local increase of the interrogation spatial density and a refinement of the local interrogation window size. The resulting spatial resolution is selectively enhanced. The method's performance is analysed and compared with some precursor techniques, namely the conventional cross-correlation analysis with and without the effect of a window discrete offset and deformation. The suitability of the method for the measurement in turbulent flows is illustrated with the application to a turbulent backward facing step flow.},

   abstract = {Optical flow cannot be computed locally, since only one independent measurement is available from the image sequence at a point, while the flow velocity has two components. A second constraint is needed. A method for finding the optical flow pattern is presented which assumes that the apparent velocity of the brightness pattern varies smoothly almost everywhere in the image. An iterative implementation is shown which successfully computes the optical flow for a number of synthetic image sequences. The algorithm is robust in that it can handle image sequences that are quantized rather coarsely in space and time. It is also insensitive to quantization of brightness levels and additive noise. Examples are included where the assumption of smoothness is violated at singular points or along lines in the image.},

The results of applying the network to both virtual-flow and physical-flow PIV data sets are presented, and the usefulness of this novel approach to PIV stereo image analysis is demonstrated. A partner-particle image-pair density (PPID) parameter is defined as the average number of potential particle image-pair candidates in the search window in the second view corresponding to a single image pair in the first view. A quantitative assessment of the performance of the method is then made from groups of 100 synthetic flow images at various values of the PPID. The successful pairing of complementary image points is shown to vary from 100% at a PPID of 1 and to remain greater than 97% successful for PPID's up to 5.

The range of Reynolds number and Weber Number based on the terminal velocity are 13 to 212 and 0.03 to 0.69, respectively. The history force expression is only applicable when the quiescent liquid is free of contaminants. Otherwise, both the steady and unsteady forces are difficult to predict because the liquid/ vapor interface is partially immobilized.},

This problem is mostly transformed into finding the sub-pixel peak in a correlation map. To address the original displacement extraction problem, we propose a different evaluation scheme (PIV-DCNN) with four-level regression deep convolutional neural networks. At each level, the networks are trained to predict a vector from two input image patches. The low-level network is skilled at large displacement estimation and the high- level networks are devoted to improving the accuracy. Outlier replacement and symmetric window offset operation glue the well- functioning networks in a cascaded manner. Through comparison with the standard PIV methods (one-pass cross-correlation method, three-pass window deformation), the practicability of the proposed PIV-DCNN is verified by the application to a diversity of synthetic and experimental PIV images.},

   title = {Uncertainty quantification in particle image velocimetry},
   journal = {Measurement Science and Technology},
   volume = {30},
   number = {9},
   abstract = {Particle image velocimetry (PIV) has become the chief experimental technique for velocity field measurements in fluid flows. The technique yields quantitative visualizations of the instantaneous flow patterns, which are typically used to support the development of phenomenological models for complex flows or for validation of numerical simulations. However, due to the complex relationship between measurement errors and experimental parameters, the quantification of the PIV uncertainty is far from being a trivial task and has often relied upon subjective considerations. Recognizing the importance of methodologies for the objective and reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) of experimental data, several PIV-UQ approaches have been proposed in recent years that aim at the determination of objective uncertainty bounds in PIV measurements.
This topical review on PIV uncertainty quantification aims to provide the reader with an overview of error sources in PIV measurements and to inform them of the most up-to-date approaches for PIV uncertainty quantification and propagation. The paper first introduces the general definitions and classifications of measurement errors and uncertainties, following the guidelines of the International Organization for Standards (ISO) and of renowned books on the topic. Details on the main PIV error sources are given, considering the entire measurement chain from timing and synchronization of the data acquisition system, to illumination, mechanical properties of the tracer particles, imaging of those, analysis of the particle motion, data validation and reduction. The focus is on planar PIV experiments for the measurement of two- or three-component velocity fields.
Approaches for the quantification of the uncertainty of PIV data are discussed. Those are divided into a-priori UQ approaches, which provide a general figure for the uncertainty of PIV measurements, and a-posteriori UQ approaches, which are data-based and aim at quantifying the uncertainty of specific sets of data. The findings of a-priori PIV-UQ based on theoretical modelling of the measurement chain as well as on numerical or experimental assessments are discussed. The most up-to-date approaches for a-posteriori PIV-UQ are introduced, highlighting their capabilities and limitations.
As many PIN/ experiments aim at determining flow properties derived from the velocity fields (e.g. vorticity, time-average velocity, Reynolds stresses, pressure), the topic of PIV uncertainty propagation is tackled considering the recent investigations based on Taylor series and Monte Carlo methods. Finally, the uncertainty quantification of 3D velocity measurements by volumetric approaches (tomographic PIV and Lagrangian particle tracking) is discussed.},

In particular, the UM Mach 2.75 Glass Tunnel with a semi-spanning 7.75 degree wedge was analyzed in attempts to explore key physics pertinent to SBLI's, including thermodynamic and viscous boundary conditions. A fundamental exploration pertaining to the effects of particle image velocimetry (PIV) on post-processing data is also shown. Results showed an improvement in agreement with experimental data with key contributions by adding a laminar zone upstream of the wedge (the flow is considered transitional downstream of the nozzle throat) and the necessity of mimicking PIV particle lag for comparisons. All CFD analyses utilized the OVERFLOW solver.},

   abstract = {The production of monodisperse tracer particles with suitable properties for optical flow investigations, such as small size, spherical shape, smooth surface, appropriate density and diffraction index, non-evaporating and agglomerating, electrically neutral, non-toxic and easily removable, is a challenging task due to the sensitivity of the particle size distribution to the boundary conditions. In order to obtain general design and operating rules for atomizers which are mostly applied for air flows, this dependence is investigated here. It is shown that high concentrations of narrow band particle size distributions, with a mean diameter below 1 µm, can easily be generated by means of multi-hole nozzles under over-critical pressure conditions, when the kinetic energy, transferred into the seeding liquid through the nozzle exits, is well balanced with the liquid volume inside the atomizer. In addition, flow visualization pictures are presented which permit a useful assessment of the functioning of the nozzles and reveal operating features of the atomizers which were not previously known. In particular, it is shown that existing explanations of the importance of certain design features of the Laskin nozzle are of minor importance for the generation of appropriate tracer particles.},

   abstract = {The extension of particle image velocimetry to supersonic and hypersonicwind-tunnel flows has been achieved in the last decade. This was mainly possiblewith the advent of short interframing-time CCD cameras with temporalresolution allowing to obtain correlated particle images at flow velocitiesexceeding 1000m∕s. The most challenging aspects of PIV experiments insupersonic flows are still recognized as the seeding-particle-selection andseeding-distribution techniques. Also, the optical access for illumination andimaging require a specific attention since pressurized facilities offer limitedoptical access. The presence of shock waves in supersonic flows introducesregions where particle tracers slip with respect to the surrounding flow.Moreover, the particle seeding density becomes strongly nonuniform andparticle-image blur can occur as a result of the strong refractive index variations.The present chapter reviews the physical and technical problems of PIVexperiments and discusses the potential of such techniques on the basis of recentexperiments performed in high-speed wind tunnels: double compression rampat Mach 7 and shock-wave turbulent boundary interaction at Mach 2.},

   abstract = {Large-scale particle image velocimetry (LSPIV) is a nonintrusive approach to measure velocities at the free surface of a water body. The raw LSPIV results are instantaneous water surface velocity fields, spanning flow areas up to hundreds of square meters. Measurements conducted in typical conditions in conjunction with appropriate selections of parameters for image processing resulted in mean velocity errors of less than 3.5%. The current article reviews the background of LSPIV and the work of three research teams spanning over a decade. Implementation examples using various LSPIV configurations are then described to illustrate the capability of the technique to characterize spatially distributed two- and three-dimensional flow kinematic features that can be related to important morphologic and hydrodynamic aspects of natural rivers. Finally, results and a critique of research methods are discussed to encourage LSPIV use and to improve its capabilities to collect field data needed to better understand complex geomorphic, hydrologic, and ecologic river processes and interactions under normal and extreme conditions.},

   abstract = {1. Recent investigations have called attention to the question as to how closely the rate of fall of particles through a fluid when very small approximates to that given by the law obtained by Stokes from hydrodynamical reasoning. This paper deals theoretically with two of the main sources of divergence from that law. Firstly, taking the particles to be smooth spheres moving through a gas, it is shown that the deviation to be expected on account of the diameter of the particle being small, compared with the molecular free path, is extremely small for such particles as have been experimented with; and a modified formula is given which may be taken to hold approximately for lower pressures or particles of smaller dimensions. Secondly, an approximate treatment is made of the effect of the simultaneous presence of a large number of particles moving with the same velocity through the fluid, and it is found that the force required to maintain the motion of one of them depends not only on the diameter, but on the ratio of the diameter to the distance between the particles, and in such a way as to increase rapidly as this ratio increases beyond the value 0·1.},

This is the first book devoted solely to a comprehensive, state-of-the-art explanation of this phenomenon. It includes a description of the basic fluid mechanics of SBLIs plus contributions from leading international experts who share their insight into their physics and the impact they have in practical flow situations. This book is for practitioners and graduate students in aerodynamics who wish to familiarize themselves with all aspects of SBLI flows.

   abstract = {Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves(1) and in the first imaging of a black hole(2). Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

   title = {Modeling Particle Drag in Accelerating Flows with Implications for SBLI in PIV - A Numerical Analysis},
   university = {University of Cincinnati},
   abstract = {Since its inception, Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) has been increasingly used to measure the velocity of the flow field, especially in aerospace applications. One of the major assumptions of PIV is that velocity of the flow field is same as the velocity of tracers in it. The ability of PIV to measure velocity depends upon the potential of tracers to track the flow surrounding them. Shock-Boundary Layer Interactions (SBLIs) have been studied extensively over the years using experimental and computational methods due to their importance in almost every supersonic flow. PIV has been doing a great job in analyzing SBLIs over the past few years but it has its limitations especially when there are high temporal and spatial accelerations. On the other hand, numerical simulations that better predict shock interactions have a hard time analyzing the turbulence properties of SBLIs. This implies that only by using both computational and experimental results together physics of SBLIs can be better understood. The current study was divided into two parts. First, development and validation of a post-processing code to be able to accommodate the solid particles. For this, Visual3 has been chosen because it lets a user control even smallest of its processes. Visual3 code has been modified to track particles using accurate physics within a flow. Forces acting on a particle in a flow were analyzed and compared using data obtained from Modified-Visual3 (MV3). Based on this data, dominant forces on a particle in high-speed flow are determined. Results obtained from Modified-Visual3 are compared with Melling(1997) data to validate the code. A specific case is solved mathematically to compare with Modified-Visual3 and Melling&apos;s data. A second validation was done using an example of a generalized oblique shock to understand the behavior of the particle passing through the shock. Finally, particle relaxation times for different particle specifications were calculated to understand which particles have better traceability to use in Particle Image Velocimetry(PIV). Second, the MV3 code was used to post-process the CFD results of the UM-PIV data. These CFD results were obtained from the numerical analyses conducted at the UC. A standard case with 2.75 Mach and 7.75&deg; wedge angle were used in MV3 to be in compliance with the CFD analysis. Particle, fluid velocities, position at every instant were collected from MV3 and were later used for comparison. This obtained data was filtered using a Python script to compare with the experimental plane defined in Eagle&apos;s (2011) work. Different particle sizes were used to compare the obtained results. These results were then used to analyze particle lag, velocity differences, velocity and acceleration contours. Finally, an error analysis was done to compare PIV, CFD and particle data. Results obtained from particulate data showed remarkable improvement in agreement with experimental data. Streamwise velocity, which was previously a major drawback, has shown a considerable improvement. This implies that particle lag in PIV plays an important role in analyzing flow especially when there are high spatial accelerations as is the case in SBLIs.},
