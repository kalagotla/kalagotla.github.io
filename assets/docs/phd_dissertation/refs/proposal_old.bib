   abstract = {Shock wave-boundary-layer interaction (SBLI) is a fundamental phenomenon in gas dynamics that is observed in many practical situations, ranging from transonic aircraft wings to hypersonic vehicles and engines. SBLIs have the potential to pose serious problems in a flowfield; hence they often prove to be a critical - or even design limiting - issue for many aerospace applications. This is the first book devoted solely to a comprehensive, state-of-the-art explanation of this phenomenon. It includes a description of the basic fluid mechanics of SBLIs plus contributions from leading international experts who share their insight into their physics and the impact they have in practical flow situations. This book is for practitioners and graduate students in aerodynamics who wish to familiarize themselves with all aspects of SBLI flows. It is a valuable resource for specialists because it compiles experimental, computational and theoretical knowledge in one place.},

A fundamental exploration pertaining to the effects of particle image velocimetry (PIV) on post-processing data is also shown. Results showed an improvement in agreement with experimental data with key contributions by adding a laminar zone upstream of the wedge (the flow is considered transitional downstream of the nozzle throat) and the necessity of mimicking PIV particle lag for comparisons. All CFD analyses utilized the OVERFLOW solver.},

   title = {Computational Fluid Dynamics Investigation into Shock Boundary Layer Interactions in the &#8220;Glass Inlet&#8221; Wind Tunnel},
   university = {University of Cincinnati},
   abstract = {<p>Mixed compression inlets offer a potential increase in pressure recovery compared to conventional external compression inlets at Mach numbers above two. However, these inlets suffer from problems with shock boundary layer interactions which cause flow instabilities and severe performance reductions. Previous experiments conducted at the University of Michigan used a wind tunnel with glass side walls and an extensive test section to measure the shock boundary layer interaction associated with a single oblique shock. This work presents an investigation of possible improvements to the current single shock experiment. A 10&#176; oblique shock generator was designed by researchers at the University of Michigan and simulated at the University of Cincinnati. The 10&#176; design did not start in the actual wind tunnel, but was successfully simulated by bypassing the transients from quiescent flow with the help of an initial solution generated from one dimensional inviscid nozzle theory. The residuals from the simulation leveled off at higher levels than expected in some mesh blocks, which indicates unsteadiness. The same case was then simulated in a time accurate manner, and showed very small variations in the solution over time. The magnitude of these variations were large enough to prevent the residuals in the steady simulation from dropping, but small enough that an averaged solution could be used for analysis. A grid dependency study was conducted and found that the 24 million node grid is very close to being grid independent.</p> <p>A new design was desired that would allow the actual tunnel to start, and this resulted in a 6&#176; oblique shock generator. This geometry allows the tunnel to start, and produces a more benign shock boundary layer interaction than the 10&#176; oblique shock generator. A follow up experiment has been designed where the oblique shock is followed by a normal shock and a subsonic diffuser. This new configuration will provide insights into the effects that combined oblique and normal shock boundary layer interactions have on the health of the boundary layer in the diffuser section of a mixed compression inlet. The extensive glass walls of the wind tunnel will allow direct access for optical measurements of the shock boundary layer interactions and the diffuser section.</p> <p>Corner separations in a tunnel affect the flow in the center of the tunnel. The oblique shock causes the low momentum flow in the tunnel corners to separate. This in turn creates shocks at the separation bubble leading edge that propagates into the flow-field. Depending on the size of the tunnel and the Reynolds number, these shocks can meet at the tunnel centerline and cause a pressure rise. This pressure rise can help to keep the boundary layer attached by smearing the pressure gradient, or intensify separations by adding an additional region of adverse pressure gradients, depending on where the corner shocks interact relative to the main shock boundary layer interaction.</p>},

The raw LSPIV results are instantaneous water surface velocity fields, spanning flow areas up to hundreds of square meters. Measurements conducted in typical conditions in conjunction with appropriate selections of parameters for image processing resulted in mean velocity errors of less than 3.5%. The current article reviews the background of LSPIV and the work of three research teams spanning over a decade. Implementation examples using various LSPIV configurations are then described to illustrate the capability of the technique to characterize spatially distributed two- and three-dimensional flow kinematic features that can be related to important morphologic and hydrodynamic aspects of natural rivers. Finally, results and a critique of research methods are discussed to encourage LSPIV use and to improve its capabilities to collect field data needed to better understand complex geomorphic, hydrologic, and ecologic river processes and interactions under normal and extreme conditions.},

   abstract = {Particle image velocimetry (PIV) has become the chief experimental technique for velocity field measurements in fluid flows. The technique yields quantitative visualizations of the instantaneous flow patterns, which are typically used to support the development of phenomenological models for complex flows or for validation of numerical simulations. However, due to the complex relationship between measurement errors and experimental parameters, the quantification of the PIV uncertainty is far from being a trivial task and has often relied upon subjective considerations. Recognizing the importance of methodologies for the objective and reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) of experimental data, several PIV-UQ approaches have been proposed in recent years that aim at the determination of objective uncertainty bounds in PIV measurements.
This topical review on PIV uncertainty quantification aims to provide the reader with an overview of error sources in PIV measurements and to inform them of the most up-to-date approaches for PIV uncertainty quantification and propagation. The paper first introduces the general definitions and classifications of measurement errors and uncertainties, following the guidelines of the International Organization for Standards (ISO) and of renowned books on the topic. Details on the main PIV error sources are given, considering the entire measurement chain from timing and synchronization of the data acquisition system, to illumination, mechanical properties of the tracer particles, imaging of those, analysis of the particle motion, data validation and reduction. The focus is on planar PIV experiments for the measurement of two- or three-component velocity fields.
Approaches for the quantification of the uncertainty of PIV data are discussed. Those are divided into a-priori UQ approaches, which provide a general figure for the uncertainty of PIV measurements, and a-posteriori UQ approaches, which are data-based and aim at quantifying the uncertainty of specific sets of data. The findings of a-priori PIV-UQ based on theoretical modelling of the measurement chain as well as on numerical or experimental assessments are discussed. The most up-to-date approaches for a-posteriori PIV-UQ are introduced, highlighting their capabilities and limitations.
As many PIN/ experiments aim at determining flow properties derived from the velocity fields (e.g. vorticity, time-average velocity, Reynolds stresses, pressure), the topic of PIV uncertainty propagation is tackled considering the recent investigations based on Taylor series and Monte Carlo methods. Finally, the uncertainty quantification of 3D velocity measurements by volumetric approaches (tomographic PIV and Lagrangian particle tracking) is discussed.},
